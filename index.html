        In 1948, Ferry Porsche invented a car. Its name: the 356 Roadster, or “Number 1” for short. It was his dream of the perfect sports car that he couldn’t find anywhere else – the start of the Porsche era.

Seven decades later, Porsche is about to launch its second incarnation: with the Taycan, the Porsche e-performance era begins.

The first purely battery­powered sports car made in Zuffenhausen marks a turning point: the transformation from a pure sports car manufacturer into the most successful provider of exclusive and sporty mobility. The transition from a hardware producer to an integrated hardware, software and service enterprise. We are continuing our business model into the digital era. But our aspirations remain those of Ferry Porsche: the dream of the perfect sports car.

At Porsche, innovation and continuity have always gone hand in hand. The new factor is the pace at which the classical business models are continuing to develop. We will need to be increasingly quick to meet customers’ desires for more flexible, safer, more individual and more sustainable mobility. Despite this new dynamic, traditional core competencies remain indispensable. Porsche is changing, but our identity remains the same.

Our product strategy gives substance to this approach. It is built on four pillars – four dimen­ sions, orientated to the different desires of our customers: our basis consists of the familiar models with sensible derivatives. In the second dimension, we celebrate our racing sport tradition. With purist, uncompromising GT and RS driving machines, we cultivate our image and refine our brand. In the “lifestyle” dimension, we combine modern vehicles with iconographic elements of earlier generations. Our plug­in hybrids and pure e­mobiles form the fourth pillar. A supporting pillar. Our future.
